Once you confirm we’re good to proceed with the next set — the meters with SLA between 50% and 90% — we’ll move forward with those accordingly.

The latest gap reading service tag was deployed on 25th march following which there is a significant improvement in gap reading issues. For instance, I conducted a gap reading analysis from 4th April to 8th April and I found that almost 70 % of the commands got success which is pretty high success rate.  As for the gateway wise analysis, please calculate the gateway uptimes for all gateways for past one week and highlight the gateways whose average uptime is less than 80% to the concerned parties as this is a significant issue which will highly impact SLA.  Finally, please note that for RF meters whenever you pull the data manually via web add Custom commands instead of DLMS commands as this may increase downlink traffic to the gateway.  We are also planning to take the Latest tags for push and pull service in the coming days which may further increase the performance. | Automation for Jira: Hi Reporter, This Ticket is now moved to Review state and will be closed after T+3 business days.

SH-4500,Proposal to Resolve SLA Compliance and Penalty Issues in RC-DC for PKG 1 & 2 ,Success Hub,Mayur Rahul,"we are incurring unnecessary penalties on IIPL PKG 1 & 2 despite successfully executing RC-DC commands in approximately 15 minutes through our HES. The penalties arise because AMISP has recently started calculating SLA compliance from MDM instead of HES.  Currently, our RC-DC command responses are sent to MDM as only ""Pass"" or ""Fail"" without a timestamp. As a result, MDM considers the time of receiving the response as the completion time rather than the actual completion time recorded by our HES. This misalignment causes us to exceed SLA limits and incur penalties.  Proposed Solution : To resolve this issue, we suggest including the meter RTC timestamp in the RC-DC response data. By doing so, MDM will use the meter's RTC time as the completion time, ensuring our compliance is accurately recorded and eliminating penalties caused by response time misinterpretation.",Open,Service Request,2025-03-26T01:44:43.259+0530,"Sanchit Singh Rathee:   Please confirm feasibility and estimate time for this  | Mayur Rahul: We can make changes, get this tested by Tuesday. | Sanchit Singh Rathee:   - Please start talks with AMISP & MDM team.

Since the issue is identified and pending work at development side. | Naman: Putting the last update here: - As written below, the next time the LS was completely down again we collated the necessary data required to confirm the root cause of the issue. PFA the stats when this was observed again. As we can see, meters are in routing and there is no outage or such. Also, the service is running as well and logging continuously and no different peculiar error logged than what’s observed before. In total, only 4 SQL Connection TImeouts observed for today's error logs. Furthermore, i dont see any error logged in EventViewer for service that matches with the Timeline for this failure and both db server health as well as Push Service server health looks good. PFA- DB server - Push Server Health: - I then truncated the RawData table in EQA and started the service over my local machine at 18:53 IST and started receiving raw data there. Will keep this up till 19:30:00 IST and didn’t restart the service manually till then.  At Prod DB - For LS rawData Received is zero, meanwhile at EQAHes it was much greater. PFA- This suggests a service miss in inserting rawData at HESRawData table in Prod and confirms point 3. Had restarted the push service then at 19:30 and LS RawData started receiving over prod after restart- Also had stopped the EQARawDataDump service then, had let it run for 10 mins more post 19:30 so we have some data post restart as well. Note :- If it relates and helps at all, The pull service is hosted over the same server as Push Service. Since Yesterday night the pull service has also failed twice under the duration of 5-6 hours.  With the following application error observed in Event Viewer but it doesn't give much context: The service error logs do not suggest anything peculiar towards a service failure but a few db conn timeouts and below TCP Errors: Snaps taken at the time of this failures - I had changed the recovery settings for the service to auto restart on failure since these were overwritten with deployment.  | Naman: Action Item (Dev Team):  Data suggests that mqtt packets were dropped client side (push service) -> Ayush will be updating the mqtt library used in core services. -> Adding an alert which will reinitialise the mqtt clients if no data is recieved for last xyz seconds. ( Dev team will update once ready for qa) | Naman: CC:    | Naman: Putting this update here - The tags with intended fix for Vayu Core push service and changes in MQTT Library are ready and tested in QA. Need to deploy the same over Prod after testing in TnD. | Naman: Update : - The fix against the same had been deployed, and the issue should not reappear or at the very least it’s consistency should be diminished. Will monitor it for a day or two and see the change. CC:    | Naman: As of now - The issue still persists, although reduced in frequency but still prevalent. For now, the service for Push data for RF and TCP has been segregated so that incase the same breaks for TCP, RF push data is not impacted and causes a complete data drop. CC:       | Naman: Closing this severity - linking this to an issue please refer for update there -"

We are unable to verify the data due to a mismatch between the Meter Data section and the LS SLA Report section, leading to continuous SLA breaches. I have also attached the list of meters pushing 46 and 47 packets, along with sample meters where data discrepancies exist between the Meter Data section and the LS SLA Report.  (AS1804204, AS1906558, AS1719452, AS2054029). 10-02-24 SLA Details.xlsx Please look into this issue and take the necessary action.

If certain data needs to be displayed on the UI, why is HES marking it as invalid?  Please consider the consequences of displaying invalid data on the UI, as it could lead to discrepancies between MDM and create an understanding gap. FYI, The  EnergyConsumptionBillingThreshold  has already been updated to 5184, based on the  EnergyConsumptionThresholdPerMinute  of 0.12. However, the bill should not remain stuck with the above code; For InvalidRTC, if the meter is in an outage at midnight on the 1st of the month, the ideal behaviour is to mark that data invalid. The bill updation and push to MDM practice is to achieve the billing SLA only, which is not expected. To ease the process, the requested report dump is scheduled for daily; if it requires even more in real-time, the DR DB access has already been shared with the CS Team. Please share your thoughts. | Jagdeep Arry:  Agree with you, not a single invalid bill or any bill with doubt should push to MDM.  you can share valid data according to you with team, if we found any validation should be added or remove we will work on it. | Annowar Hussain:    sir, my requirement was to have invalid list as and when required so as to take correct action specially when team are on field.

PFA -   Sir Can we please ask MDM what is payload & API they are using for the same. | Naman: Hi, update:-   Regarding the 5 group commands, starting with DP, as mentioned yesterday, HES did not receive any DP group commands, so we cannot comment on that. For the remaining 4 group commands, where some responses show as pending in MDM, this appears to be due to the notifier service failing—a recurring issue we've observed. To confirm this, we checked the logs for one of the meters showing a pending response in MDM. However, since we don't have logs for the 19th, we couldn't verify it definitively, but it's most likely related to the same issue.     Below are the snapshots for the success and Failed responses for other 4 Group commands:   1.) For LP:                  4 ---> Success                5 ---> Failed   2.) For PF:   3.) For VE:    4.) For CE:   From the database screenshots, it’s evident that most of the pending command responses are actually included in the successful count, so this doesn't seem to be a significant concern.

Someone need to give us input on that. A few day ago, Tarun and Devesh had discuss on the same. No input received till now. | Jayant Dadhich:  Tarun and I had a discussion with IIPL on 18.11.2024, where we explained the limitations regarding Occurrence ESW. They requested us to share the proposal logic for implementing the restoration. I’ve spoken with Tarun, and he may be able to provide you with further clarity on this. For now, we need to finalize the logic to share with IIPL and obtain their approval."

Took logs and shared with CAVLI team for further debugging. Conclusions after experiments: 1. Meter is doing reset the NIC after every 3 minutes in case NIC is not attaching to the network. => Seems like this was designed for JIO’s nbiot NIC and it should not apply to Neoway and CAVLI NICs.     need to confirm this. And modify the meter FW if required. 2. CAVLI team has done some experiments on Meter1’s NIC and found that it was not connecting to the network and after clearing the sim info as shown below; this NIC is always connecting to the network but for roaming case, it takes ~4 minutes to latch to the network after reset. This solution needs to be validated with JIO team as well to check side-effects. | ramdas.singathiya: Few more experiments done at Raipur site as results are as below: 1. With the help of Tulsi Ram from Kimbal we took logs for 2 CAVLI NICs at site. NIC1_sim1 is good sample. NIC2_sim2 is not connecting to the network. => Logs has been shared with CAVLI and JIO network team. JIO team is looking at logs for the RCA. NIC1_NIC2_experiment_logs.zip 2. After 1st experiment’s log analysis; JIO network team suggested to disable “FakeCellOpt“ in the faulty NIC and shared the logs again. Still the NIC is not latching to the network. Logs has been already shared with JIO network team. JIO team is further analyzing the logs. Logs_after_FakeCellDisable.zip | Nikhil Naik: The major concern at Tata Power right now is Error Code-0 and 5. Ramdas ji has been in discussion with Jio and CAVLI for the past two months regarding issue identification, as 5,000 meters are currently non-communicated. Two versions of the NIC have been dispatched to the site, and the issue persists in both versions. Logs attached for Reference, and some of the NICs start communicating if we reinsert NICs again and again. and some of the NICs start communicating after SIM replacement.  One observation in Error code-05 is that some of the NICs are resetting itself within 5 to 10 sec.

We have effectively taken care of the issue of using an expired token. But we observe these errors for a few commands stating that the response sent ended prematurely, and these errors seem to be persistent only for below - CommandTypeId 52 24 54 Also, please note that these commands do not have their corresponding response or internal API Content file.

We tested it with a few group commands, and it is working as expected.         Please ask MDM to test the same once and observe if any discrepancy still lies.

We are still facing integration issues. | Manash Hazarika:  Sir plz confirm who has checked the data model in prod server before dispatching the materials. | Manash Hazarika:      FYI | Ranjeet Singh: can the heading have the project details and   please don't assign tickets to support team it was already taken care by our Auto pager duty alerts. | Shiva Sharma:     Can you please add the business case of opening this as a sev-1 incident for 354 meters? | Naman: Changing this to Sev - 2, since this needs time, and we might need to check one of the meters with help from field team. Also, out of the total raised concerned meters, only 49 have wrong templateId and rest >300 have the correct MeterTemplateId i.e. 23. Checking raw data for now - | Naman: Update : - For now we have corrected the 49 meters template id. | Manash Hazarika:  It’s not just about the quantity but the issue of garbage data. These are all prepaid meters, and MI for a few AMISPs is already in halt in a few places. A single complaint from a consumer or a brief mention in the daily newspaper or digital media could bring our MI to a halt. Please consider this carefully before commenting. | Naman:           The highlighted packet is what we’re getting after putting meterTemplateId → 23, below packets (1. Intended Packet with correct RTC, 2. Another Packet with incorrect RTC) are what we’re getting with meterTemplateId → 10.    Can you please suggest what we can look into here. | Naman: Hello,  Update:  P.S.  Also, we've parsed the data in both environments and can confirm that the raw data is accurate, but issue in parsing in the same due to meter template id. CC:             | Naman: Update : -  Tags are ready for Push, Pull and Db Changes. Additionally, Sanchit is working on getting approval for a tentative downtime tomorrow evening to deploy the push and pull services along with essential database changes needed to support template ID 23 for three-phase meters.  To facilitate this, we’d like to test on TnD first. Biplob Chutia, could you please provide a few test meters for both single-phase and three-phase setups for testing these before moving these to prod. | Biplob Chutia: This is not resolved yet,      | Naman: Update : -  Tags are ready to be deployed, but first we need to resolve RC/ DC command issue as suggested before bringing such huge changes to prod. | Naman: Update: Following yesterday's deployment for the Web, API, Push, and Pull services, we are now receiving LS data with accurate RTC datetime stamps. However, IP data is still missing in the relevant tables. Upon reviewing the raw data for several meters where LS data is being received, we found that no raw data is present for IP, while it appears as expected for LS. PFA - Raw Data  - LS :- IP :- We suggest doing FOTA on Meter as we can see HES is receiving no Raw Data for IP      Changing severity to Sev - 3 for this, since only IP Remains now CC:       | Biplob Chutia:  sir, Will the IP push issue be resolved by doing FOTA, your intervention is required pl suggest. cc-        | Naman: As suggested by Tarun Sir, we’ll get a meter with f.w. and config setup and observe the IP Push for the same first. Once we have some more clarity and data to work with over the issue, we’ll move forward FOTA on a few meters to see if that fixes the issue. | Biplob Chutia:   As suggested, We have also Shifted two test meters in EQA and checked but IP push is not available. cc-    | Naman:   I had conveyed the same earlier also, we were not getting any Raw data for IP in AIIB Prod. After shifting two meters to EQA today too, same was observed again as confirmed by Ayush Patel too. Have assigned the ticket to Tarun Sir for now for further action items and if any checks remain. CC:          | Biplob Chutia:  sir   sir, IP Push data is still not available for  three phase AIIB, Plz look into it, since the issue is pending from long time. | Ranjeet Singh: hi   can you please reach out to Engineering team as this is pending at there end and the incident ticket lies under app support. Let us know if any support required from app support end and change the severity accordingly. | Sekhar Chebolu: Are these meters in Delhi? | Biplob Chutia: No Sir, 5k Meters dispatched to AMISP and approx 1100 meters are installed in field. | Tarun Sharma:   Discussed with Muzahid, we do the NIC FOTA from tomorrow.  | Biplob Chutia: Moving to Review as IP push data is available after OTAP"

Repeatedly querying a large dataset is not efficient and can be time-consuming to investigate from scratch. For meters where raw data is not being received, the issue is likely hardware-related, and in such cases, we cannot provide further assistance. As previously advised, the recommended approach is to first check data availability after replacing the NIC, rather than the entire meter. If data transmission resumes following the NIC replacement, this solution can be applied to other meters. If not, replacing the meter will be the next step. | Ritik Kumar:     PFA file  PFA the file containing 3 sheets  and The request here is to check what all meters are teher which is out of this list and share those metera nd i’ll check for them, cause 90% of meter would belong to this list.   | Satya Brat Nath:  Share the requirement as discussed | Satya Brat Nath: There was a Big Escalation from APDCL HQ.

The issue of receiving less packets at the HES is separate, but this ticket has been opened specifically for the lesser packets (47) received under the SLA, even though the full packets are being received. We’ve seen a pattern of huge given meters for which packets are lost at HES, routing with bad sourceEndpoint. Ex: AS1697352 - 45 packets were received both at the HES and under the SLA. The packet loss occurred due to routing issues during that interval from the source endpoint: 98,254, caused by a Gateway/Sink Shift or RF Restart. Why was the GR not added for the packets in that interval? This is because no MissedPacket was recorded for that rtcdateTime.

This parameter is not used in the network decision making and is not critical for the network operation.  Thus, at this point, individual hop count values far from the average hop count should be considered more as a cosmetic issue and can be omitted. | Automation for Jira: Hi Reporter, This Ticket is now moved to Review state and will be closed after T+3 business days.

CC:      | Shiva Sharma: Hi Team,      Below are the cases that have been observed. 1) We’ve seen instances like AS2068561 meter shared in the 17th GR analysis but it was installed later on the 18th. Since meter installation happens daily,  we should make a practice to check the  InstalledOn, and GetRTC results . 2)  We’ve found meters with LIFO issue:   What LIFO issue is ?  The meter pushes data for backdate through push (even though the RTC and templateId seem correct) which requires RF OTAP to be performed on them.  Similar Issue :     Since the meter pushes DP data for backdate,  and the GR searches for MissedPacket of the previousDay only to add commands, and due to no MissedPacket, no GapReading would get added against them. Ex:  AS2068561 meter pushes DP data for June whereas the data comes with the correct RTC for other profiles i.e., LS, IP.   3) We’re seeing still missed packets for DP for RTC before yesterday but since GR only processes MissedPackets for the previous day, and hence they packets are getting skipped.   Sorry, but we weren't able to review all the analyses that were shared. Will follow up with Muzahid to collect RF versions and ask for OTAP for the needed meters.    We’ve checked for  Meters whose No DP received ever (verified with rawData) and their meterTemplateId seems correct. There are ~30 active meters that we should look to investigate further. Can you please check their meter status from your end and confirm if they are lab meters? Please get things checked like RF re-plug, replace RF, meter restart , and try DP through custom, and DLMS commands.

( identified with IsInternal: 1 flag) Ex: AP10408284 → 12 GR commands were added, and APS needed to be marked as failed those 12 commands to restore the system during the SAT incidents. To address this, we have modified the  Events SAT case flow  to prevent concurrent transactions from running simultaneously and allow them to process in batches without blocking or freezing other transactions. # NO GR Commands We can see there were GR commands present for the shared meters. (Have checked with multiple meters) Ex: AP10410547, AP10408315 Let me know, and we can discuss it over the team's call or in the office. | Shiva Sharma: We will discuss deprioritizing recharge commands that are not working with the developers and will post an update here.

CC:    | Naman: Update:- Since MDM didn’t receive any response for the said RC command despite our logs showing no such error and successful retrieval from MDM too, we reinitiated the response once more from our end that seemed to fix the issue.

Will dig deeper into why this happened and revert back with findings | Naman: Hi    Can you please once confirm if this issue still persists, if so please share a new list of meters where this is visible.  As i have checked for the below meters again where createddate was before, on and after 30 and i see responses were formed correctly  If this issue is still visible, will observer again and raise a bug accordingly.

I've been occupied with a high-priority integration due to a tight demo schedule for another project. I plan to resolve this and close it by the end of today. Thank you for your patience. | Sujata Saikia: Hi   A8184923 rc command not processing, can you please check  | Naman: The command seemed to be stuck, I have reinitiated the command once on the above meter, it is processing and taking tries now you can check PFA-  Looking into the discrepancy now | Naman: Hi   , As discussed over the call, can you please share current data, where still the discrepancy is visible between MDM and HES. As it is really hard to map with stale data.  Thanks | Sujata Saikia: Hi   this is the recent sheet where we can see the issue between mdm and hes. Please look into it | Naman: Hi, I've reviewed several meters where the MDM Status indicates ""In Progress,"" even though the command has been completed on the HES end. Upon examining the data, it appears that the response intended for MDM is corrupt, which is why the MDM Status remains ""In Progress."" However, the response was successfully received by MDM with a Success Code: 200. For example, consider the meter PU2973209. After the command is completed, its response is sent to the Nohangfire Table, which then processes and sends it to MDM. Unfortunately, the response generated at the HES end is:  [{""jobName"":null,""jobMeterStatusResponse"":{""meters"":[{""meterId"":null,""status"":""Fail""}]}}] . In contrast, the response received from MDM is:  [{""Code"":""200"",""Description"":""SUCCESS""}] . When I manually reinitiate the response to MDM, the correct response is generated, and the status is accurately reflected in MDM as:  [{""jobName"":""esya_utility_RC_040000050568RC02092024092527"",""jobMeterStatusResponse"":{""meters"":[{""meterId"":""PU2973209"",""status"":""Success"",""response"":[{""controlState"":""Connected""}]}]}}] . It seems that the issue might be related to the Notifier Service.    and   , could you please assist with this and investigate at your earliest convenience? Thank you. P.S. I have raised a bug for the same    | Naman: Hi       Luv has implemented changes with internal logging for our HES API to track and log responses. I request the team to closely monitor this issue and report any occurrences back here as you did previously. We will analyze these internal responses to find a resolution. Thanks | Sujata Saikia: Hi   i have checked again, and noticed that few meters are still in progress while they are success in hes. Kindly check the issue and resolved it , A8182467 A8183291 PU2946101 PU2963549  Adding the meter nos for more reference. | Naman: For clarity: Please provide the details in the same descriptive format as previously, so we can map them accurately with the data in the database. Additionally, ensure that we are only referring to commands that were added after my previous comment. This will help us review the logs specifically for these recent commands and avoid including older ones as there will be no logging to check. Thank you. | Biplob Chutia:  kindly provide | Sujata Saikia: Hi   These are for the reconnection status. I hope this will help you in the process.  fyi | Naman: Update: We have reviewed the responses generated after the recent changes to the notifier service and have successfully removed those with null values. The remaining task is to track the request ID for the response, which will be deployed shortly. Once this is complete, we will reinitiate the responses listed above and follow up with you to verify the MDM status. | Sujata Saikia: Please mention it how long it’ll take to complete the task and reinitiated the responses, as there are many meters that are found to be with the same issue today itself. i have attached the file also .    Also it has been affecting in 15min SLA . Kindly solve this issue asap | Naman: Hi    Have made the said changes in service and reinitiated the response to be sent to MDM, the newly formed response now is: Against which the response received from MDM is: Please confirm if the MDM Status for this command is updated now on today’s date or not. If it is then the issue is fixed now, and such behavior won’t be observed again. Then we can work for rest of the commands, for which I will need a list of all such previous commands where response on HES is concluded but In Progress in MDM, will reinitiate those and status will be then visible on MDM.  CC:    | Naman: Hi    As confirmed over the chat, the bug stands resolved now and MDM status is updated for the above command. This issue won’t bug anymore. Also, please provide the said data and will manually reinitiate their response. Thanks | Naman:     Can you please ask the MDM team to send the Request ID sent from HES against the data with the said discrepancy, will manually push those older command responses and we can close this then. | Naman: Moving this to review for now, will manually reinitiate the said once received from MDM, the bug stands resolved now. | Automation for Jira: Hi Reporter, This Ticket is now moved to Review state and will be closed after T+3 business days.

I can see no GR against meters since 08-08-2024. More meters which communicated after 08-08-2024 are also available and if required can be attached.   cc   sir   sir   sir | Shiva Sharma: Hi     Since No MissedPacket is present for billing, no GR commands have been added. We saw a few timeouts in BillingProfileMissedPackets in  DeleteMissedPacketForPreviousMonth  but not with AddMissedPacket. We have reviewed the code and SPs and found an issue is likely with AddPacketToMissedPacket SP. The MissedPackets add packets for NextRTC parameter value but its value gets assigned based on the below logic. and the nextRTC what the GR code snippet finds is ‘2024-08-31 18:30:00.000’, and is why the MissedPackets don’t add. We will discuss this with the devs and keep you posted with the updates. Thank you!! | Shiva Sharma: Hi    We’ve created a prod bug for the issue we identified. Ref:     As a workaround, We have created a scheduler job to add MissedPackets of meters for which monthly bill not received so that GapReading can collect all possible bills. Now onward, the missedPackets would be available for GapReading to pull the possible bills. Please check and update the ticket status accordingly.

However, A workaround was added to get this done, and can see now the Gapreading of Billing is running after 8 too, and adding GapReading commands for meters whose bills have not been received. We checked the list you mentioned the commands were processed, there might be a delay due to higher precedence commands.

Current Behaviour, MissedPackets are deleted around the 8th of each month, which is why GR commands were not being added for billing after the 8th.

The utility has called our senior management and threatened to remove all installed meters, which could lead to us being blacklisted and barred from future tenders. Does this still seem like a SEV-3 ticket to you? Regarding the template change, Satya has rectified 5 meters to the best of his ability, despite lacking proper training and working under pressure from the utility's senior management. This task is not within his job description, and he received no support, even though a SEV-1 ticket was raised. Please provide an update on the remaining 12 meters that Satya could not rectify by changing the template ID.    Sir need your intervention.

They are just passing on the penalty to us and these amounts are more than the O&M invoice that we have to charge both the AMISP per month. Which means they are ready to deduct amount from the Supply. Anvil has also asked for debit note and all our payments are stuck.  Current Issues on these Projects are RF Optimization, RTC Drift Meters, LS RTC Wrong meters, Stuck of Gap Reading command, NO ODR Command in Max meters.

These are the meters for which daily has not happened since they have been converted to Prepaid. Also, I have checked that the DP is getting created in HES at 12:00 AM as per RTC and before 8 as created time , daily, but in MDM it is getting pushed somewhat after 12:00 PM, hence Daily billing is not done.  Discuss with me for any further information, else check why late response is being pushed. cc:       ",Close,Incident,2024-07-29T18:27:54.282+0530,"Shiva Sharma: Hi    As discussed, we’ll look into this and will share an update. Thank you!! | Bhuwan Dixit: Hi Shiva, As discussed, let me know the progress of the issue asap.   | Shiva Sharma: Hi Bhuwan, As per AARMS calculation, it does calculate the daily billing whose DP data is available at MDM till 11:30 AM and skips for meters whose daily DP data at MDM is received after 11:30. We are seeing this in MDM and looking into the HES end. We are still working on it | Bhuwan Dixit:  I am not getting it, what you explained is billing logic that is ok, but question is why these meters only pushing dp data in MDM after 11 AM, result in no daily billing. | Shiva Sharma: Hi    We meant as per the logic mentioned in our last comment, that If the DP data comes within 11:00 AM of the day then only its daily billing would be calculated by AARMS else skipped at MDMS. Furthermore, the DP data might be received at any time during the day as per their network communication health, and there shouldn’t be any issue. We checked for multiple meters like AS1974262, and AS1974261 and observed that their DP data was later camera after 11:30 AM which is why not participated in daily billing. Below is the ss of the instance where daily billing was skipped for DP data of 28th July as it was created on 2024-07-28 at 14:31 PM. MDM ss:  HES ss:  FYI, Daily billing does not rely on the DP SLA data; such data goes through streaming APIs which sends the data instantly, and is why it reflects the data at HES and MDMS time simultaneously.

SH-1011,Anvil DTR Meter: LS Data for 750 Meters is Zero in HES. ,Success Hub,Jagdeep Arry,LS Zero DTR LTCT Meters. But IP & LS are available for these meters. Request you to look into this on priority,Close,Issue,2024-07-27T18:06:24.714+0530,"Satya Brat Nath:  sir, Please look into this issue. This is very critical | Manash Hazarika:  5 days have passed and we are still not getting an update ??? | Ritik Kumar:     I’ve checked that that data is not there for ls the very initial step we can do is to initiate the command and check whether the commands are successful or not and if yes so if the meters are sharing the data. but since there is an ongoing issue of slowness in AMI for the command process, it will take time but I’m pulling the commands. we didn’t initiate the commands yet to avoid the bottle neck scenario to occur as this would hamper billing and RC/Dc as well. I’m looking further and will share an update soon. | Manash Hazarika:  we are asking why these meters data not available. We need RCA for that. You need to check template ids and whether these meters are pushing raw data or not !! if not you have to add cmd and then need to check the response of the command. then you can check cmmd process or not !! command failed or success . if success data is available or not !! we need RCA not general comments. if  system is not working u need to tell us educate us why it is not working. u took 5 days just to inform the below general information. this is not acceptable. PLZ do let us know what is the next step to resolve the issue of these meters.  | Manash Hazarika:  i am again requesting you plz do involve yourself and help us in getting the issues resolved. I will wait till monday and after that i will raise all tickets in incident as i have committed to utility that all issues will be resolved by 10th of august.        Sir FYI.. | Ritik Kumar: Upon further investigation, we discovered that out of 749 meters, 744 had continuous gap readings added due to missed packets. However, the data from these gap readings did not help us maintain the SLA, as 666,100 gap reading commands were added, with the majority (665,777) failing. Since the gap readings did not provide the necessary data, we attempted a manual data pull on 189 meters out of the 749. From these 189 meters, we successfully obtained the majority of the data where pull commands were initiated. Consequently, we have complete data for 175 of the 189 meters where manual pull commands were initiated. To avoid this situation, Customer Support (CS) could have manually pulled the data when it became clear that gap readings were ineffective. If the manual pull commands also failed, CS should have escalated the issue to us mentioning that neither of the way helped to get the data pulled from meters so we could further raise it to the development team. Now, we are left with 2 actions, 1. Adding pull commands for the meters where data is not there. 2. Check for the reason for the gap reading command failure on the majority of the meters. I’m adding commands as of now and will keep a tab on that so that we won’t fall into a bottleneck situation where we can face stuck situations for other commands.     Regards, RItik | Jagdeep Arry: Hi   , As Ritik has already mentioned that 749 meters with zero LS have all gap-reading command failed. Now Ritik is trying to add Command with RF 1, if these command got successful and required data received against the command then we will state that there is some issue with RF or Meter and causing low SLA for these meters. Action to be taken, We need to replace one of the meter and sent the meter along with RF to debug the issue by Engineering team. Till the time team debug the issue and conclude something,   add some script that we add command for these meters on daily basis. | Ritik Kumar: sure    | Ritik Kumar:   we initiated almost 40k commands out of which 34k succeeded and I’ve re-initiated the failed commands again as of now. now, to handle the situation, we are constructing a job that will delete the missed packet and manually add the pull commands for the time being. Regards, Ritik | Manash Hazarika: But why these meters are not pushing any data? Any findings !! and Solutions      | Ritik Kumar:     I have investigated the issue further and found that 749 meters push the DP data but not the LS data. secondly, if we are not getting the raw data, it means there is no issue with the template id, its with the RF, and that meter is not pushing DP data. Please try to replace the RF of any meter and check if we are getting push DATA after replacement If now, let us know.   | Chandrendra Singh Chauhan:     Pls check if resolved, we can close. | Automation for Jira: Hi Reporter, This Ticket is now moved to Review state and will be closed after T+3 business days.

Here is the Summary: - I request you to check the following points which are concern for us. I am attaching the sheet for your reference.   | Swati Mishra: To address the concerns regarding gap readings: Gap Reading Success and packet is missed:  is largely due to receiving LS data of other RTC  dates. This is due to  incorrect meter data, RTC drift in the meters, or instances where the meters send no data. Attached is the data received against the GR Commands for 8155 Meters  GR - Success after 8hrs  Gap readings are added in batches based on routing and queue status, so it’s possible for GRs to be added later. Additionally , poor meter Communication/ high hop count or pending commands on the meters may also add to the delay of GR commands to  process. GR Not Initiated Since the analysis share is of an 8-hour data window, we have confirmed that GR has been added for  meters with available communication. If a meter is not communicating, GR will not be added for the meter. Gr has been previously initiated on these meters, indicating that the process is functioning correctly. In conclusion, GR appears to be operating as intended. Please let us know if you have any further concerns. | Automation for Jira: Hi Reporter, This Ticket is now moved to Review state and will be closed after T+3 business days.

We need to keep an eye on the SAT10 tentative meters and share meters for which RTC is not getting synced. | Shiva Sharma: Hi    The RTC sync for SAT10 meters was done for almost all comm meters. We’ve observed that ~1000 meters are the ones whose RTC is still drifted in the SAT-10 list out of which 77 meters are the ones on which we synced the RTC successfully and got drifted again. Also, Please share your inputs & challenges regarding RTC sync. Thank you!! | Annowar Hussain:  checking RTC from IP data is not correct. Meters having advance RTC will show no drift in IP data when data arrive late in HES. This process caused 73 meter with observation of RTC drift in 10% IP ODR test. Also RTC drift table showing drift as 0,1,2 in many meters. | Shiva Sharma:   The drift in IP data could be varied since it relies on the Travel Time of raw data However, Please consider the GetRTC from the meter as a source of RTC drift. The meter RTC works with a crystal oscillator whose performance/frequency degrades over time and can be drifted in meters. If we sync the meter RTC, we can not consider that it won’t drift again so we need to mark those meters and should keep an eye once in week. Let us know if we are good to close this case or post here if there are any queries.

Thank You! | Swati Mishra:   Meter list updated. SAT-21 meters available in Filter now, | Swati Mishra: This ticket has multiple issues. The issues in the ticket have been addressed with the respective assignees on/before 24 July. Issue-wise breakdown for tracking purposes: Issue: Data not visible on UI (Meter Data profile) but available in DB    Reason:    Validation was deployed for LS and IP, which had an issue where the pull data was not getting validated, hence it was not visible on HES. Fix:    Below ticket has been raised for  the development team. Meanwhile, a workaround is created to validate the data.   Issue: More than 48 packets available in LS SLA Report    Reason:    All packets received will be shown in the report. Issue: Mismatch between LS SLA Report packet count vs. DB Data shared packet count    Reason:    The logic for the query for DB data is slightly different from the query we use to share DB data. The difference between DB data shared and SLA report data is expected due to the difference in the logic of the report creation. Even though the difference is not significant , to maintain uniformity , we would require preliminary analysis on the difference from CS, and then we can clear it with the development team as well. Please create a separate ticket with this analysis as it is specific to SLA report data.

SH-845,Issue in RTC SYNC REPORT _APRAAVA APDCL,Success Hub,Shiva Sharma,"Hi   , Just had a call with APDCL & AMISP , there are some concerns for  RTC sync service functioning  Below are some observations       Eg: 1. for meter  AS1981533  METER RTC sync is functioning to sync from 21 minutes to 20 ,Same case for  AS1977131 . synced from 16 to 15 but not working since then.  As per our logic it should work for meters having drift  below 60 minute s and If it is working then it should sync it for 5 minutes daily which is not happening.  2. SC10224934, Meter RTC  was correct, but it drifted and then did not sync.  3.  NO RTC sync for GPRS meters. Though they are GPRS Meters, it should be auto sync, but all these meters is having drift.  What is the mechanism to sync these GPRS meters. Need to share the timelines. Creating the ticket with highest priority, I need to send this justification to AMISP and subsequently to APDCL by tomorrow. cc:               ",Close,Issue,2024-07-12T17:09:22.255+0530,"Bhuwan Dixit:  any update on the ticket. | Bhuwan Dixit:  picked up this ticket yet? | Bhuwan Dixit: Hi   ,Its been 3 days since I opened this ticket on high priority, haven’t received any reply.

We’ve also registered the newly shared meters but they are not in communication.   | Atul Raj:   is checking the other three meters. | amit kumar sharma:  Please correct the template id for Three phase meter AP16002436 | Shiva Sharma:  We updated the MeterTemplate to 14 of AP16002436 as 14 is mapped for 3P FG23 Meters. | Shiva Sharma: Hi    Yesterday during the dry run, we faced an issue, The command is pulling profile data with ' isvalidated ' NULL, causing their IP data not to be visible on the HES UI.  We manually set ' isvalidated ' to 1 for the IP pull data to ensure it was visible on the UI during the dry run. The HES UI is able to read pulled data for LS and DP with ' isvalidated ' as NULL, but not for IP. Opened a linked bug :    Thanks!! | Atul Raj:  It seems this issue is in all the environments. While this will be checked by Devs, i think SQL job can be created to update the isvalidated field.   Your thoughts? | Atul Raj:   Have we tested all the functionality from Web and API? Not sure why the ticket has been moved to bug raised. | Ritik Kumar:   Since we have caught 2 bugs within the testing, we raised those two.

",Close,Issue,2024-07-08T18:33:18.177+0530,"Shiva Sharma: Hi    Yes, It is reproducible. If we add a  custom billing command  with commandValue  {""From"":1,""To"":10} , it fetches all bills present in the meter  inclusive of the current datetime bill . Let’s say the meter has 5 bills for the past 5 months, the current actual behavior of entry range for 1 to 10 bil pull command fetch 6 bills, 5 for past months and generates 1 bill with current datetime.  This designed flow of custom commands is configured in meter firmware.   Can you please share your thoughts for more clarity on this custom commands behaviour for entry range 1 to 10? PFA ss for reference: Thank you!! CC:    | Jagdeep Arry:   It is not recommended to add command with {1,10} or any other values. You can add value according to below format only. any commandvalue other than mentioned above could pull the data that would not be required. | Jagdeep Arry:  Please share the correct understanding of commands among the team to avoid confusion. | Manoj Kumar:   Yes, the example mentioned is correct. In custom command , Bill pull with entry range will include the current bill also. So , if we want the latest bill then  command can be get with (0,0) with RF2 and to get the previous bills , if we know the total bill in the meter then we can add the command with entry from  (1 to (total bills - 1)). | Annowar Hussain:  sir, I resorted to the following value (1,10) in few meters as bills were getting fetched by only this value and no other. I might miss some other values which I have not tried. Can check attached meter list for various other command values passed in bill pull command but yielding no result. Will require guidance and uniformity in command value to avoid trial error trial hit method to save time and other unwanted harassment and escalations.  currently there are around 3800 meters bill pending, and I expect to try different values in around 200+ meters to fetched bills. Also for RFCOM1, the issue is not yet fixed as command do not execute and get failed if triggered from RFCOM1. All issues faced after and related to the following ticket   , highlighting it so as to help in resolution to above issues. cc            | Shiva Sharma: Hi    The bill generation depends on multiple factors as shown below  -> Communication Health,  Gateway Health / Bandwidth ->Meter inside activities [ Can be checked by Events / ESW ] when the meter is supposed to generate a bill. -> Invalid Bills [which does not validate due to multiple Errors like ZeroPowerOnDuration, InvalidRTC, Duplicate, MDVaExceeded] Try DLMS for the total bill count present in the meter Try the Custom RF comm-2 command value  0 to 0  to get the current Bill. Try the Custom RF2 comm-2 command (1 to (total bills - 1)). | Automation for Jira: Hello, CS Team This Ticket is now moved to Review state and will be closed after T+3 business days.

Updated on the team regarding this . Meter requirement from the field   cc:    | Atul Raj: RCA by:  For Information:               Updating it here for records. Analysis was done on 4 site meters (JA8040209, JA8036229, KA6017353, KA6126901) Four meters were received at the Naraina office on Thursday, with issues related to 254EP. All meters were tested and found to be working fine, with no reboot issues (254EP). Additionally, the meters that were replaced in the field are also working fine.   There are some observations that could explain the issue:     One more Point regarding this issue - In the Sink, we set the application configuration bytes. Among these bytes, there is a parameter called otap_manager_action, which can have the following values:   typedef enum {     OM_ACTION_NONE = 0x00,     OM_ACTION_PROPAGATE = 0x01,     OM_ACTION_PROPAGATE_AND_PROCESS = 0x02,     OM_ACTION_LAST = OM_ACTION_PROPAGATE_AND_PROCESS } om_action_e; In the OTAP manager file of the firmware, there is a condition that if om_action is OM_ACTION_PROPAGATE_AND_PROCESS, the NIC will reboot itself. In the field, we are encountering this issue because we are setting this byte to 2 (i.e., OM_ACTION_PROPAGATE_AND_PROCESS) during the OTAP.  Some of our NICs are continuously switching from one gateway to another. As a result, the NIC receives the application configuration change packet from the Sink with this byte value, causing the NIC to restart itself. In some cases, this issue resolves automatically in the field because the value comes in correctly. To resolve this issue, we need to set this byte to 0 (OM_ACTION_NONE) after the OTAP. This appears to be one of the major reasons for the problem. Also verified this scenario in the Naraina office. Please refer to the logs for more details. In logs , attached the Nic condition by changing the app config byte. As per the third point, it is not required to change the NIC firmware. The focus should be on the sink side (i.e., the gateway side).  | Automation for Jira: Hello, CS Team This Ticket is now moved to Review state and will be closed after T+3 business days.

Please review this ticket and re-assign if any further assistance required from App Support | Shiva Sharma: Hi     1)  In Aurangabad, the environment has just 110 meters active, and the  service picks 1000 meters  at a time to process for RTC-sync. Similarly, in Nashik, there are only 600 meters active. Therefore, the Auto RTC-sync will not work with the current service functionality due to less number of meters installed. 2) The background service is frequently disconnecting from the broker. However, the issue does not seem to be with the broker, since other services on the same server, like GapReading working fine & with MQTT Fx. The updated background service deployment is covered in the current sprint. | Shiva Sharma: Hi     We’ve raised this for devs and marking this ticket as Bug_Raised.

CumulativeEnergyKvahImport now I have checked the code provided by the DEV team, as per this code, there is only a check applied on CumulativeEnergyKwhExport: Here,  dailyLoadProfile.CumulativeEnergyKwhExport  is checked to ensure it is not less than 0 (negative). If any of these energy readings are negative, the  isValidated  flag is set to  false  and the  errorCode  is updated to include the  NegativeData  error code. and there are 5 checks applied on CumulativeEnergyKvahImport: These checks ensure that  CumulativeEnergyKvahImport  is validated for being non-negative, within a specified threshold, and not exceeding expected consumption limits.

So here is my finding: For the first case, the raw data is coming for only 18 meters out of 37 meters. out of these 18 meters, 5 meters template was wrong and one meter data was ok and rest of the meters are sending garbage data.   For the second Case: the communication of the meters is not proper. We are getting the routing either with 254 or 98  which means that the RF is rebooting itself and meter is continuously switching gateway or sink.   | amit kumar sharma: Thank you for quick action.    cc:     "

The extra packet arrived for RTC: 2024-05-20 10:40:23 which came through the pull command and should not be validated since it was garbage data. Will open a dev ticket for optimizing the validation checks and attach the ticket here. Why did we raise this ticket to the Highest priority?

Thanks!! | Shiva Sharma: Hi    We’ve opened a high-priority ticket for the devs to improve validation checks:    Moving this ticket to bug opened. Thanks!! | Megha Sehgal: Immediate solution - Template ID has to be manually inserted    Long term solution - Unified NIC will be out in November. | Jagdeep Arry:  Check LS Push for today for below condition. How many meters has pushed with NonZero Minutes RTC and check for the same by parsinf the rawdata. | Shiva Sharma: Yes, It is still reproducible, and datetime reflects the same in rawData too. The count of meters is less with this behavior. | Jagdeep Arry:  Referring to the last screenshot shared by Shiva, Data was wrongly pushed by RF only | Megha Sehgal: Waiting for Unified NIC.   Please see if this gets resolved with Unified NIC. | Sagar Patel: As I can see the RAW Data Attached, there is no issue with the NIC Firmware, as NIC only get data from the Meter including Date & Time and send it to the HES.    Unified NIC cannot Solve this type of Issues. | Megha Sehgal:  Please suggest next steps for this ticket | Jagdeep Arry:  You mean Meters returning these data to RF against the command?  Can we check data using DLMS pull against the same duration? If yes share the data if meter have same data then Sagar’s statement will be correct otherwise RF is parsing the data incorrectly. | Sagar Patel:   Yes, the meter stores the  Blockload   Profile  Data in its memory. In such cases, the NIC requests the stored data and transmits it to the HES. Note that there is no control over the date in this scenario.   Please Check this with RF1/DLMS Pull Command and share the Result Here. | Naman: I pulled LS data for the same day shown in the screenshots, as well as for recent days, for 3-4 of the meters listed below. The issue of  rtcdatetime  having a non-zero seconds component is not reproducible with DLMS commands. | Sagar Patel:  Please Share the result here.  | Naman: PFA the DLMS commands triggered - And as we can see here, against these HesCommandIDs, no RtcDateTime field has a non zero seconds component- Same way for minute component, with all fetched packets having rtcDateTime field only either 30 or 00. PFA - | Sagar Patel:  Looks like this is a Request Data that you attached. The Problem Occurs is with the Response we got for this request. Please Check the response for the Same. Previous Attachment (Request Payload): - | Jagdeep Arry: Hi     According to    comments It is cleared now that meter does not have any data with non zero seconds like we have 12th second (2024-09-12 02:30:12) data in pushed data, so according to example/data shared it is pretty clear that RF is corrupting the data while pulling it from meters and parsing it so that it could push to HES. If it is yet not cleared to you don’t hesitate to call me instead keep on commenting on this thread. And proceed to debug the RF code to resolve the issue."

Refer below my comments for your observations. - It seems either meter has wrong (corrupted) data for that particular entry, or the data is corrupted while sending to NIC. Chances for second case are rare. Comment:  There are many such cases in field. If the meters has the corrupted data, how is it sending the correct response in 1st push and garbage in 2nd push? Also, what is your take on the 1st case shared by  ? Which says the data is garbage for 1st and 2nd push as well. As confirmed by   Some of the meter is pushing the multiple records at 4:00AM. Please do check that as well. - One  query : Daily profile is pushed once a day at fix time. Here, we have received two times in same day 15-Jun! What is the correct time set for Daily profile? Comment:  DP data is pushed twice. One at 12:00AM and another at 4:00AM. However, the data pushed at 4:00AM is captured at 12:00AM.   can you please confirm this? | Pandurang Chauhan:  Let me know the NIC and meter versions running in the meter having RTC issue. Also, since when these issues started being observed after installation. | Atul Raj: Hi, Sharing the RF FW version for meters which are sending corrupted data either in the 1st push or 2nd push. This issue started since installation. | Pandurang Chauhan: Also share the Meter Firmware version. These meters should have FG13. | Atul Raj: All are FG-13. Will the DLMS response of the GetFWVersion work? | Pandurang Chauhan:  No, GetFWVersion command will give version of NIC and not of Meter. There is another command from HES for this. It is as shown below: | Atul Raj: I tried pulling for 1 or 2 meters, the implementation is not done to read internal version it seems. I can share the HES credenials. Let me know if it helps. | Atul Raj:  I have noticed one interesting thing. Checked 10 meters randomly. Command through RF1 is failing for the meters. | Pandurang Chauhan: Which command is failing through RF1? Get Meter Version? | Atul Raj: All the commands. | Pandurang Chauhan: It should work. In case of RF1, NIC has minimum processing of Data coming from HES. Need to check with HES team. | Atul Raj: Command processing  - will check with HES team.

Wish to pull multiple DP and check the data for multiple meters  | Atul Raj: Shared in teams | Atul Raj:  Were you able to identify the issue? | Pandurang Chauhan: Not yet.  Checked in the NIC code for pushed entries of DP at times other than at 12 AM and found that it is programmed to improve the SLA. These extra entries are pulled from meter by NIC and pushed to HES. | Pandurang Chauhan: Do we have the percentage for meter with issue of wrong RTC in DP?

So, it seems the RTC is wrong not only in DP, but in meter itself. I am checking further other meters from list - Garbage_ANVIL_DP_Data.xlsx | Atul Raj:  Please share your finding. | Pandurang Chauhan: I have analyzed about 7 meters in detail and results are as below: Analysis document is attached here. Anvil_Jnk_KA6002747_Issue.docx | Atul Raj: Please share the solution for  | Atul Raj: Please share | Pandurang Chauhan: We are working on that solution and planning to release for Apraava APDCL project first. Will update you. | Atul Raj:   - The issue was raised for J&K. Not sure why the fix is being done for apraava. Please share the timeline for J&K. | Naman:  this same issue is observed in AIIB too, where meters pushes DP multiple times with incorrect older RTC  | Ayush Rajput:  this issue is getting severe now , we have to resolve this asap. CC:            | Atul Raj: This was one of the major observations during recent SAT in J&K and we were hardly able to manage the SAT. The issue is pending since more than 3 months now. CC-        | Ayush Sinhal: ++   | Pandurang Chauhan: Will share the RF NIC firmware having modifications for debug as with previous firmware the root cause for multiple DP entries is not clear. | Pandurang Chauhan: RF NIC firmware is ready with modification. I will test it today.   Kindly allocate one resource for testing in QA also. We should test the FOTA also to make sure that in the field, FOTA will happen without fail. | Pandurang Chauhan: Here are the two firmware for RF NIC having modification related to find the reason for multiple DP entries.  Till now, if there is an entry of DP at 12 AM, only one extra DP Push entry is sent by NIC to HES at 4 AM for backup purpose in case earlier one is missed.  Now in modified RF NIC firmware, this extra (re-push) entry will have 0x80 (128 in decimal) value as shown below (I have discussed and confirmed with Ayush Patel that HES is not using this value). Along with this, there will be diagnostic messages at EP 27 related to this event whenever there is re-push of DP. This two firmware are for two different APP_AREA_ID - 0x833C92 and 0x833C94. At my end, I have tested below RF firmware CRYSTAP_1P_FG13_Anvil_JnK_Prod_(v11..12.2.3)_(29082024)_0x833C94. and found working as expected. Need to find compatible meter firmware for other RF NIC firmware to test.  Kindly plan to test this both firmware. Repsuh entry of DP will be after 4 hours of first push of DP for a day. We can set RTC few minutes before 12 AM at any time and wait for first DP push and then after 4 hours there should be only one more entry of DP push. Kindly share the raw data of this extra DP push. | Pandurang Chauhan: Here are the updated firmwares with modified debug messages.  Kindly plan to test this for Daily profile. Daily profile entry will be repushed only once after 4 hours of set time for Daily profile. These both entries must be same. | Megha Sehgal:  Can you take the next steps for this? Here is the meter number KA6139534 | Ayush Sinhal:     We need to look at this case and figure why we took 3 months to resolve and what could have been done better.  | Megha Sehgal: Learning from this ticket that we could apply to future such tickets. The RF NIC firmware will not be applicable to all the meters for which this issue is reported. Because many meters have wrong RTC in the meter itself. I have analysed 7 meters and out of that 5 meters have wrong RTC in meter itself, so DP data will have wrong RTC. Out of 5 meters, RTC was set for one meter.  Other team should analyze this before in time and should propose the solution accordingly.    has asked for two meters from field for more analysis and found that one meter was burnt (They should have checked first at their end that the burnt meter was of no use for analysis!). Another meter seems to have RTC module issue (Hardware). cc:      | Atul Raj:  - We have tested the firmware on 2 meters received from field. The meters stopped communicating after the upgrade. Please suggest the further course of action on this. CC -    | Pandurang Chauhan:   Kindly let us know which firmware was used and when and on which meters (Kushal or Intelli 1P). There is a dependency of app area id.  Kushal 1P meters have app area id: 0x833C94. There is another app area id in this project (Anvil Jnk): 0x833C92 which should be of Intelli 1P meters. The meter I have received from field is working after upgrade of RF NIC firmware. Update : There is no dependency of App area id to communicate with gateway and send data to Gateway. | Nikhil Naik: We have use FW file - Kushal_1P_FG13_Anvil_JnK_Prod_(v11..12.3.3)_(05092024)_0x833C94 Meter No. - KA6101070 , KA6104148 Meter - Kushal 1P (ANVIL-J&K) Meter FW - CRY 13.00 Encryp - AUTHENKEY_JANKA1 | Pandurang Chauhan: Thanks   for quick update.  After RF NIC firmware upgrade, meters were not found in routing? If found in routing, no data was received on HES? | Nikhil Naik: Meter are in Routing with source end point - 254  | Nikhil Naik:  Can we merge the DP data issue with the LS , Bill push data, as the same issue arises in LS , bill data as well  During the push, data is retrieved by date instead of by entry. | Nikhil Naik:   we have checked the DP data , you may merge these changes to Bill and LS data too | Pandurang Chauhan: Ok. Will add the solution for LS data having wrong RTC (reverse entry, right?). | Atul Raj: Yes, any timeline for this? | Megha Sehgal:  Any updates on this? | Atul Raj:  This is pending since months. Pls help with the OTAp file for LS,DP and Bill fix."

They are just passing on the penalty to us and these amounts are more than the O&M invoice that we have to charge both the AMISP per month.

Current Issues on these Projects are OTAP not completed, RF Optimization, RTC Drift Meters, LS RTC Wrong meters. We all know the issues but closing all of them in a single day is not possible. So its my simple request maintain LS of both AMISPs up to 99 % for all the active meters with in 72 hrs criteria.  PLZ attach active meter list of both the AMISPs.  Sir as discussed yesterday there is no other way out. if we have to maintain LS manually or add on from back end than we have to do it. ** moreover Anvil is in order to giving LOA for 3 more projects in northeast so its my prime most concern now that their SLA in our running projects are up to the mark. ** Also attaching debit note for your references.",Close,Issue,2024-05-17T08:58:50.230+0530,"Manash Hazarika:        Sir FYI.. | Manash Hazarika:    16th May LS ODR analysis. out of 3 lakh meter 1.84 lakh meter meter is having less LS Data and ODR cmd found only in 42 k meter.

First I would request you pull the LS data for all the impacted meters for all the impacted dates. 2. Once all the commands are processed and come into a final status (pass or fail), SLA should be calculated. 3. After analysing the SLA report, I would expect a list of meters from you along with the date range for which the packets are missing hence SLA got impacted. 4. I’ll work on the impacted date range's impacted meters to achieve the SLA.

Should it be raised as a bug? or if there is anything that can be done from the APS end only? | Jagdeep Arry:   Could please share the source from where you got the data attached in description. | Shiva Sharma:  Could you please share an update here? | Shiva Sharma: Hi    The issue seems at the prod level with these 74 meters, as the rest 4 billing data correctly arrived.

SH-141,Techno | Routing of meters from EP-254,Success Hub,Tarun Sharma,"Routing is frequently coming from EP-254 for schnieder make meters installed in field under Techno-J&K project. Routing from EP-254 means that RF is frequently rebooting. We have two meters (one 1Ph and one 3Ph) in our office where in the same issue was observed while connected in test bench during Jammu SAT. We tried to recreate the issue in our office by connecting the meters to a variac. It is noticed that when volatge below 140V is given to the meter, routing starts coming from EP 254. But the voltage received to RF is constant even for low volatge. Interesting to note that, meter stopped communicating even through BCS cable when 140V was given to meter connected in our office. While the low voltgae hypothesis is correct, there are other scenarios we need to explore. One meter (K9010544) installed in field, where the same issue was observed had normal voltage and meter was communicating through BCS as well.

I just took those meters which are having drift of greater than -10 min , 1 to 50 min and extremely large value in min from last IP. I created a table for these meters which is approx 59556.  The job which i have created will add the GET RTC for 5000 meters daily and update the completed on , json response and drift in min in the table for success commands. Then It will add the SET RTC commands for the meters which is having drift of greater than -10 min , 1 to 50 min and extremely large value in min and update the table for completed on ,created on and SET success or not. Then after success of SET RTC commands, it will again add the commands for GET RTC for the SET RTC success meters and update the table with latest drift in min. Today it added 5000 commands for GET RTC, out of these 2296 were success. It added 64 SET RTC Commands, 55 commands were success. after that 55 commands again added for GET RTC and 49 were success. There is one meter which still have Drift RTC even after SET RTC were success JA8002981 | Ayush Rajput:   I have analyzed the data in Techno Today on the basis of SLA. When I extract the SLA from DB for the SAT meters, I have found that only for 1,60,982 meters SLA is available out of 1,63,112 meters. 2130 meters are missing from SLA because these meters are non-com meters. 1044 meters didn’t communicate in this year and 1009 meters were last communicated in JAN and rest of the meters communicated in start of Feb only. Then I checked for the meters which are having LS SLA less than 30 %. the count of such meters are 490. out of these 490 meters , 4 meters communicated either in 2023 or in JAN. 39 meters communicated between 10 to 20 Feb last, 56 meters between 20 to 26, 220 meters communicated between 1 to 10 FEB. 171 were communicated today but most of them are communicating with source end point 254. I have 2 or 3 meters out of these 171, these meters send data in between whenever meter communicated that means communication is not good. So basically the overall conclusion of this analysis is that the communication is not good for these meters. I am further investigating it.

Meters do  push IP.xlsx We have different MeterTemplate i.e., 7 for these meters, updated MeterTemplate for a single Meter SC10222197. Will see if IP push and meter other profile data generates well now for this meter SC10222197. Regards, Shiva | Shiva Sharma:  | Shiva Sharma: Hi    The IP data correctly arrived for the meter SC10222197 and we did the needful for the rest of the meters.:  Meters do push IP.xlsx There would not be any issues now. Kindly monitor it and let us know if you see an instance in the future. Also, This ticket was raised to check for an issue with a single meter and If you add more meters, kindly update the subject of the task. Are we good to close this ticket? Thanks!! | Annowar Hussain:  checked first 6 meters and found none of them generating push IP data, rest data are not checked. Kindly do needful | Shiva Sharma:  We updated MeterTemplate just before dropping a comment. Kindly look tomorrow for meter push IP data and let us know. Thanks!! | Annowar Hussain:  pls find current status | Shiva Sharma: Hi   ,  All 127 meters are pushing IP data for which we updated the meterTemplate and the meters you mentioned are not from the list I shared. We did the needful for the shared meters and the meters should IP push data now. Thanks!! | Annowar Hussain:   sir, checked first 5 meters. none of them pushed IP data since comment posted | Shiva Sharma: Hi, These meters are not pushing other meter profile data too, even though meters are in routing. Updating MeterTemplate doesn’t in this case, I’ll look into this issue more to figure out the root cause. Also, I found few more meters with such issue. | Shiva Sharma: We tried some operations on the below 4 pending meters and will monitor them for the next upcoming data. SC10222836  Pending  SC10224927  Pending SC10223216  Pending SC10224925  Pending SC10237656  Done Thank you for your patience.  | Shiva Sharma: Hi   ,  Could you please get the below meters checked, meter routing is available but the below meters not pushing data, as no raw data is present against them.  SC10222836 SC10224927 SC10223216 SC10224925 Awaiting Response. Thanks!! | Annowar Hussain:  this is the issue raised in ticket against the meters, please check why only pull data available and no push data. | Shiva Sharma: Hi    We checked for all the basic checks like no template issue and no raw data arriving for the meter push etc. Well, I’ll discuss the same internally too. Could you please confirm the RF firmware version of these meters? and request you to please arrange a field visit for one. Thanks!! | Satya Brat Nath:  We have no option to fetch the RF version. It can only be provided by the embedded team I think.   Or request you to provide a application to fetch RF Firmware Version manually Also if push is not available in a particular meter, its a bug as meter needs to push each & every data captured.  Is FOTA required for this bug to get fixed or Meter replacement is Required?  Is NIC Change can solve the issue or NIC FOTA is required? Share your opinion as it's a long pendency & it needs to be solved asap please cc:   sir | Annowar Hussain:  today 2 more LTCT meters installed SC10217001 SC10217002. these meters are monitored by IRCA and so all data transfers must be OK. both these meters are not pushing IP and other data. Resolution required  urgently.CC     | Shiva Sharma: Hi   ,  Below are the meters with incorrect MeterTemplateId for which we are not receiving any IP record but other data arrives as expected, we’ve updated the meter template and their IP records should be available for upcoming RTC. Let’s monitor the data against them for today. Will check tomorrow to see the data against them . Thanks!!"
